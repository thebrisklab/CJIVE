# CJIVE

Joint and Individual Variation Explained via Canonical Correlation (or CJIVE) searches for directions of joint variance within two data sets. CJIVE analysis allows extraction of so-called "joint scores", which act as a summary of the joint information found across data blocks, and joint loadings, which exhibit the strength with which a variable contributes to the joint variability. CJIVE also allows for extraction of individual scores/loadings. These quantities are based on directions of variance that are unique (not shared) to a dataset. 

The file "CheckAJIVE_v_CJIVE_Simulations" provides an example of how to implement CJIVE and compares it to AJIVE. Both analyses use "toy data." The toy data are constrcuted in a manner similar to the simulations in our CJIE manuscript.
