# CJIVE

Joint and Individual Variation Explained via Canonical Correlation (or CJIVE) searches for directions of joint variance within two data sets. We employ CJIVE here to examine sources of variability that are common (or joint) across measures of functional connectivity and structural connectivity and sources that are unique to a data type (i.e. individual.) CJIVE analysis allows extraction of so-called "joint scores", which act as a summary of the joint information found across data blocks, and joint loadings, which exhibit the strength with which a variable contributes to the joint variability.
