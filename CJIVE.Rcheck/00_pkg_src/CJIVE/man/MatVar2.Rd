\title{Alternative calculation - Matrix variation (i.e. Frobenius norm)}
\usage{
MatVar2(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix of any size}
}
\value{
The Frobenius norm of the matrix X, calculated as the square root of the trace of t(X)%*%X
}
\description{
Calculates the Frobenius norm of a matrix, which can be used as a measure of total variation
}
