\arguments{
\item{n}{integer for sample size, i.e. number of subjects}

\item{p1}{integer for number of features/variables in first data set}

\item{p2}{integer for number of features/variables in second data set}

\item{JntVarEx1}{numeric between (0,1) which describes proportion of variance in the first data set which is attributable to the joint signal}

\item{JntVarEx2}{numeric between (0,1) which describes proportion of variance in the second data set which is attributable to the joint signal}

\item{IndVarEx1}{numeric between (0,1) which describes proportion of variance in the first data set which is attributable to the individual signal}

\item{IndVarEx2}{numeric between (0,1) which describes proportion of variance in the second data set which is attributable to the individual signal}

\item{jnt_rank}{integer for rank of the joint signal, i.e., number of joint components}

\item{equal.eig}{logical (TRUE/FALSE) for whether components should contribute equal variance to signal matrices - default is FALSE}

\item{ind_rank1}{integer for rank of the individual signal in first data set, i.e., number of joint components}

\item{ind_rank2}{integer for rank of the individual signal in second data set, i.e., number of joint components}

\item{SVD.plots}{logical (TRUE/FALSE)  for whether plots of singular values from signal should be produced - used to confirm number of components}

\item{Error}{logical (TRUE/FALSE)  final data sets should be noise contaminated - default is FALSE; use TRUE to obtain pure signal datasets}

\item{print.cor}{logical (TRUE/FALSE)  for whether to print matrix of correlations between subject scores)}
}
\value{
A 'list' object which contains 1) list of signal matrices which additively comprise the simulated data sets, i.e. joint, individual,
        and error matrices for each data set; 2) list of simulated data sets (each equal to the sum of the matrices in part 1);
        3) list of joint subject scores and individual subject scores for each data set, and 4) lsit of joint and individual loadings for each data set
